# GUI Sandbox Project ðŸŽ¨

Welcome to my **GUI Sandbox**! This is a fun and experimental project where I mess around with different GUI ideas, animations, and mini-projects using Python and `tkinter`. It's a playground for creativity, learning, and trying out new things.



## What's Inside? ðŸ§°

This project is a collection of small experiments and sub-projects, including:

1. **Transparent Window with Animated Objects**  
   - A semi-transparent window that sits on top of your desktop, with little objects animating across it. It's like a fake desktop overlay (just for fun!).

2. **Form-Based Windows**  
   - Simple forms and input fields to experiment with user interaction.

3. **Basic Games**  
   - Super simple games to explore game mechanics in a GUI.

4. **Other Random Experiments**  
   - Whatever else I feel like trying out! This is a sandbox, after all.
